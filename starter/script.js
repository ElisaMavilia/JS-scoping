// SOLUTION 1 WITH SELF
       /*  const self = this; 
        The variable self is used to save the value of this from the outer context (the calcAge method) and make it available inside the isMillenial function. This is necessary because:
        In a regular function (non-arrow function), this does not retain the context of the method where it is defined but takes the context of the call. In strict mode, this means that this is undefined in regular functions if they are not called as part of an object.
        Saving the value of this in a variable like self allows access to the correct context, regardless of how the inner function is executed.

            console.log(this);
            console.log(this.year >= 1981 && this.year <= 1996); //this keyword is undefined

            console.log(self.year >= 1981 && self.year <= 1996);

                console.log(this.year >= 1981 && this.year <= 1996); // the result is true because the arrow function uses the this keyword from the parent scope (jonas)
        }; 

        isMillenial();
    },

    greet: () => console.log(`Hey ${this.firstName}!`), // The result is undefined because the arrow function use the parentÂ´s scope (in this case the global scope where the object jonas is located) It is better to not use the arrow function as a method but instead using a normal function expression
